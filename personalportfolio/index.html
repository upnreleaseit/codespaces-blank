   <h2>Information about me</h2>
<section>
  <p>
        I'm in 11th grade and go to Norwood Norfolk District. I plan on graduating and going to either the Military or the Navy to persue a better career. I am currently learning how to code HTML and we have done a tiny bit of CSS and JavaScript. I'm learning how to build my own websites and make them interactive. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I highly enjnoy playing games so if I can learn how to code even a simple game like flappy bird (which I have before) would make me happy. Gaming is basically my life or was at one point now I no longer own a system to play on. 
    </p>
    <p>
     If all doesn't go to plan with the Military or Navy I will just make a career out've simply making websites for bigger compainies.
