        <h1>Basketball</h1>
        <p>
            I enjoy Basketball because I been playing since I was 4. All I'd do is practice my whole life if I had the choice and time. I enjoy the competition basketball brings especially everyone is taller then me so I have to play hard to stay off the bench.

        <h1>Rainbow Six Siege</h1>
        <p>
            I really enjoy playing Siege with Codey Bond. Rainbow Six Siege is a game based around the game mode search and destroy from COD but is a very team based game with gadgets that can be placed. Every operator has there own unique Ability and every operator has there. tactical which can differ but be the same with all operators like grenades, flashes, and Bulletproof Cameras. I played the game before I met codey but when we met I was terrible. Codey was the one that made me wanna try and get better the first season ive ever played with Codey I hit Emerald 4. I use to play everyday even hitting diamond 5 but that was the last season of ranked I played. Right now I think if I had a Xbox I'd be atleast emerald 1 diamond 5 area.

        <h1>Clash Royale</h1>
        <p>
            Clash Royale is a card based game for free on mobile! You have a 8 card deck but you only get 4 cards at a time. Each card varies from different rarities ex. Common, rare, epic, legendary, and Champion cards. I am pretty okay at it when it comes to ladder (You collect trohpies to get higher in the ladder each game you win.) There are 25 arenas with 15k being the highest trohpies being able to reach.
